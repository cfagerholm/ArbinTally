# ArbinTally
Initially designed to count the number of days a cell is on test for invoicing, but may be used for additional purposes

Input: a file list from arbin station and each file that collected data in the past month (a list compiled by a different script)

Output: a csv including the file names, the number of days each cell was actively testing, and a discretionary sum of days where the cell may not have been actively testing, which may be reviewed by the user and subtracted from the total sum of days a cell was on test.
